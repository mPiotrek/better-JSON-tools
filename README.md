# JSON Tools – better edition

This is an alternative implementation
of the 'JSON Tools' project
for the Software Engineering course
(Artificial Intelligence; summer semester 2020/21)
at Poznań University of Technology.

While the original is supposed to be written in Java,
here I decided to try using Servant DSL for HTTP request handling
and Aeson for JSON manipulation.
